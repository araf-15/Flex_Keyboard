# Flex_Keyboard
This project is my university life microprocessor project. I got the 1st prize to make this project on Department project show day 2019. This project was build for the hand disable people. Those people who are physically hand disable and can to operate with computer or can not write in computer this application was build for them, they can simply ware  gloves and we attached with the finger of the  gloves with flex sensors. Our project was divided with 2 section one is hardware part and another one is software part. In hardware part we use simply a micro-controller named Arduino. Our approach was capture the signal from the flex-sensors through Arduino and pass that signal information to the java application and The application take the signal and find out which finger is flexed, and the application also count the number of attempt to flexing the finger. The the application go to the exact number of the character in character plate and after some milliseconds to selecting that character the character is consider as a final character and write that character in the writing window. We also make a future plane to implement word prediction in this project but we are not go to that part as our limitations of time.
